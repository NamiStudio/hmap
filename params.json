{"name":"Hmap","tagline":"Image histogram remapping","body":"An image histogram remapping script written in Python 2.7 by [Anthony Kesich](http://akesich.com) and [Ross Goodwin](http://rossgoodwin.com). Changes source image so that source image's histogram matches target image's histogram. Requires PIL/Pillow:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo pip install Pillow\r\n\r\nTo run Hmap, cd into the directory where the hmap.py (for black and white images) or hmap_c.py (for color images) is located. Ensure source and target images have the same height and width dimensions (in pixels), and place them in the directory. Run the script with 2 additional arguments (source and target image files) as shown in the following example.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    $ python hmap_c.py source_image.jpg target_image.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nSource Image:\r\n\r\n![Source Image](http://imgur.com/MGCUWZo.jpg \"Source Image\")\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget Image:\r\n\r\n![Target Image](http://imgur.com/vuGrjAY.jpg \"Target Image\")\r\n\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n![Result](http://imgur.com/KavoDjf.jpg \"Result\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
